# Working Notes for Claude

This file captures persistent preferences and project context for Claude sessions

## About the human in this project

**Akhilesh Malani** — accessibility architect and digital inclusion strategist.
**Screen-reader user**, primarily NVDA and JAWS on Windows. Less proficient
with VoiceOver on macOS than with NVDA/JAWS on Windows.

The audience for many of the drafts I prepare (mailing-list replies, beta
tester invitations, follow-up emails) is **also the blind community**. Many
of them are screen reader users.

## Mandatory style rules

### Every instruction step I write must be screen-reader-first

This applies both to:

- **Instructions I give Akhilesh directly** in chat (how to install something,
  how to navigate a dashboard, how to verify a setting).
- **Drafts I prepare for Akhilesh to send to others** (mailing-list replies,
  emails, tester briefs).

Specifically, this means:

- **No visual locators.** Never say "look at the top-right" or "the icon
  in the corner" or "the third button from the left".
- **Use keyboard navigation language.** Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, arrow
  keys, screen-reader-specific hotkeys (H for heading in NVDA/JAWS browse
  mode, B for button, F for form field, K for link, D for landmark,
  VO + Cmd + H on VoiceOver, and so on).
- **Use direct URLs wherever possible** to bypass UI navigation entirely.
  If the destination has a deep link, give the URL instead of "navigate to X
  by clicking Y then Z".
- **Reference UI by label text and role**, not by position. Say "the button
  labelled Save" not "the Save button at the bottom of the form" — labels
  are unambiguous to a screen reader; positions are not.
- **State what the screen reader will announce** at each step where useful.
  "Your screen reader will announce 'Page loaded'." "NVDA will announce
  'button' followed by the button's label."
- **Acknowledge known accessibility quirks** of the surface being used.
  Example: Chrome's side panel sometimes does not appear in F6 cycle on the
  first press; tell the user this proactively rather than letting them
  discover it as a failure.

### Tone

- **Plain, direct, no marketing language.**
- **Honest about limitations and false positives.**
- **No celebratory or congratulatory framing** unless explicitly warranted by
  a real achievement. Akhilesh has flagged that "this sounds rude" feedback
  once — calibrate to warm-but-direct.
- **Brevity over comprehensiveness.** When in doubt, shorter is better.

### Modifiers Akhilesh uses

| Modifier | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `/silent` | No preamble, no commentary — give the answer directly. |

## Project context (as of this writing)

- **Personal-Website** (this repo) — akhileshmalani.com portfolio + AMASAMYA
  web platform at amasamya.akhileshmalani.com subdomain.
- **AMASAMYA Chrome extension** — published on Chrome Web Store at extension
  ID `blnfmiipkccpggpinjofhhglfcgglbif`. Currently at v3.2.0 with 17 audit
  engines.
- **Public source** — github.com/accessitestai/AMASAMYA (mirror of the
  extension code; MIT licence). The full Personal-Website source remains
  private at github.com/accessitestai/Personal-Website.
- **Hosting** — Netlify. Auto-deploys on push to `main`.
- **Domains** — akhileshmalani.com (root portfolio), amasamya.akhileshmalani.com
  (audit platform).

## Things to avoid

- Suggesting screenshot-driven debugging unless Akhilesh has already supplied
  the screenshot.
- Suggesting Akhilesh "look at" anything visual on a UI.
- Suggesting "pin the icon to your toolbar" or other visual-affordance tips.
- Recommending tasks that require GUI clicks when an equivalent CLI / URL /
  keyboard path exists.
- Adding emoji, decorative dashes, or visual ASCII art to any output Akhilesh
  will read with a screen reader.
- Bulk-replying with "this is great work!" — Akhilesh prefers honest
  assessment over encouragement.
